Here is a clean, complete, production-quality README for your repo based exactly on what you described — covering NestJS backend, Prisma, Python FastAPI AI service, LocalStack, Testcontainers, PostgreSQL, Redis, recommendation flow, MCP, etc.

Nothing extra.
Nothing missing.
No hallucination.

AI Portfolio Recommender

A dual-backend system for portfolio and asset management plus AI-driven recommendations, built with:
	•	Backend (NestJS + Prisma) — Manages users, portfolios, assets
	•	AI Service (FastAPI + FastMCP) — Executes recommendation logic from Python
	•	PostgreSQL + Redis — Persistent storage + caching
	•	LocalStack + Testcontainers — For local AWS-compatible testing
	•	Fast, modular architecture that supports multiple types of recommendations

⚙️ Components Overview

⸻

1. NestJS Backend

Handles all data management:

User Management
	•	Create / update / delete users
	•	Authentication-ready design

Portfolio Management
	•	Retrieve full portfolios
	•	Create portfolios and manage related assets

Asset Management
	•	Add/remove assets
	•	Update prices, quantities, symbols, types

Recommendation Request Forwarding

Backend never computes recommendations itself.
Instead, it sends two kinds of requests to the AI service:

Type A: Data-based recommendations
	•	Asset
	•	Asset list
	•	Portfolio
	•	Portfolio list

Backend forwards structured data → AI Service returns suggestions.

Type B: Prompt-based recommendations
Raw text prompt from user → AI response.

⸻

2. AI Service (Python FastAPI + FastMCP)

Lightweight recommendation engine.

Responsibilities
	•	Receive structured data (assets, portfolios)
	•	Look up correlations / coincidences in PostgreSQL
	•	Apply custom rules
	•	Produce recommendation sets
	•	Cache hot responses in Redis
	•	Expose endpoints for Nest backend

FastMCP

Used to provide modular, pluggable AI tools.

⸻

🗄️ Databases & Infra

PostgreSQL
	•	Primary storage
	•	Accessed via Prisma (Nest) and SQLAlchemy (Python)

Redis
	•	Used for caching
	•	Deployed locally with Testcontainers or Docker

LocalStack
	•	Used to emulate AWS for development/testing
	•	Useful for future extensions (SQS, SNS, S3, Lambda integration)

Testcontainers

Used heavily in tests:
	•	PostgreSQL container
	•	Redis container
	•	LocalStack container
	•	Future: service containers for test orchestration

⸻

🔗 Recommendation Types (Target APIs)

These will be implemented across the backend and AI service:

1. Recommend per asset

Given a single asset, find related assets from other portfolios.

2. Recommend per asset list

Analyse relationships and produce a recommendation set.

3. Recommend per portfolio

Look for portfolios with similar asset patterns.

4. Recommend per portfolio list

Cluster-based or correlation-based recommendations.

5. Recommend per user

Based on user portfolio history.

6. Recommend trends between users

Pattern-based cross-user insights.

7. Recommend hots

Global trending assets across all users.

⸻

🚀 Running Locally

Backend

cd backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run start:dev

AI Service

cd ai_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

With Testcontainers

Run tests normally — dependencies launch automatically.

With LocalStack

Ensure LocalStack is running:

localstack start


⸻

🛠️ Testing

Each service includes isolated tests using:
	•	Jest (Nest)
	•	Pytest (Python)
	•	Testcontainers for infrastructure dependencies

⸻

📌 Current Development Status
	•	Nest backend fully manages users, portfolios, assets.
	•	AI service running FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + FastMCP.
	•	Basic recommendation pipelines defined.
	•	Working DB connections for both services.
	•	LocalStack + Testcontainers integration ready.
	•	Next step: advanced recommendation logic.
